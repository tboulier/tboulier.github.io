intro: "Hi! I'm a researcher in experimental quantum physics. I focus on exploring systems of many bosonic particles in strong interaction. I'm especially interested in giving interactions to photons. I've worked with two types of systems: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductors and ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, and I have a strong interest in merging techniques from these two fields. Most of my recent research was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship)."
