intro: "Hi, welcome! I'm a researcher in experimental quantum physics. I focus on exploring systems of many bosonic particles in strong interaction. I've worked with two types of systems: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductors, and ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. I currently work in the team led by Antoine Browaeys, in the quantum optics group of Institut d'Optique, Palaiseau, France, on arrays of cold Rydberg atoms."
