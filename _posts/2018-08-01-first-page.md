Engineering new, complex states of matter is an important area, impacting both our fundamental understanding and practical applications. One promising approach is to rapidly oscillate some parameters in order to obtain a new effective system; this is the so-called Floquet engineering. Under the right conditions, new properties can emerge that are not present in the static system. However, such oscillations carry energy which can be absorbed, and one might generally expect heating. Energy absorption in interacting many-body systems, unlike in non-interacting systems, is an interesting open question with practical implications for quantum engineering. Recently, theoretical work predicted that interacting Floquet systems can be inherently unstable, which would be visible as fast heating. We experimentally investigate this instability, confirming the mechanism and the fast heating. We also report an unexpected additional heating, pointing to effects beyond current theories.

In our recent experiment at JQI, we studied a Bose-Einstein condensate in a periodically shaken 2D optical lattice, where the position of the lattice is the oscillating parameter. Several shake trajectories were tested, such as along one lattice axis, along the lattice diagonal and in circles. Such driven cold atom systems have been proposed as a means to engineer topological, correlated states. In the presence of the drive, the Bogoliubov spectrum can become unstable, whereby density modulations spontaneously grow and deplete the condensate. We studied the condensate lifetime to characterize this instability. Under most conditions, the observed heating follows the theoretical predictions. However we observe giant decay rates for a narrow parameter range, which were not anticipated.

Our work is available to all on the ArXiv (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07637). A simultaneous experiment by our colleagues from the group of Dr. Monika Aidelsburger at LMU/MPQ, Munich, confirms and complements our work. They study the case of a 1D lattice, and observe directly the growth of the unstable modes' population to characterise the unstability. Their work is available on the ArXiv as well (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07462).

Future work will investigate the unexpected super-instability to better inform our theoretical understanding. Another research path is the possibility of suppressing the instability at high shake frequency when confining the system to limit the density of states (3D lattices).
