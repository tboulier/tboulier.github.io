As a hobby, I also enjoy spending some night under a beautiful dark sky. 

I use an old 8" Schimitt-Cassegrain telescope on a motorized German mount(Celestron C8 S-GT), a simple DSRL (Canon 650D), and some long-learned voodoo to make pictures of my favorite objects.

My best pictures are on my [Astrobin page](https://www.astrobin.com/users/AstroPanda/). Here are a few more:
