As a hobby, I also enjoy spending some night under a beautiful dark sky.

Most of my pictures are on my Astrobin page (https://www.astrobin.com/users/AstroPanda/). Here are a few examples:
=======
I use an old 8" [Schmidtâ€“Cassegrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt%E2%80%93Cassegrain_telescope) telescope on a motorized German mount (Celestron C8 S-GT), a simple DSRL (Canon 650D), and some long-learned voodoo to make pictures of my favorite objects.
