Quantized vortices are one of the most striking manifestations of the superfluid nature of Bose-Einstein condensates.
In our work with Alberto Bramati at LKB, we used exciton-polaritons – the bosonic quasiparticles arising from the strong coupling between cavity photons and excitons in a semiconductor microcavity – to generate vortices by injecting angular momentum into a polariton superfluid.
Since polaritons have a short lifetime, many questions remain open: is the angular momentum conserved? Can a large angular momentum spontaneously break down into individual quanta?
How long does the angular momentun survives?

In a series of studies, we tackle some of these questions. We show that vortex lattices can arise from the superfluid flow ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1186 ), 
that angular momentum can be injected by careful engineering of the superfluid flow ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02680 ), 
and that patterns of elementary vortices of the same sign can be engineered with light-shaping technologies ( https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09230 ).

The body for work shows that at high polariton density the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton repulsion completely dominate the behaviour of the system, that can be described as a 2D quantum fluid. 
Strong interaction between photons drives a transition between optics and hydrodynamics!
