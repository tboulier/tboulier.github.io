Topological defects such as quantized vortices are one of the most striking manifestations of the superfluid nature of Bose-Einstein condensates and spectacular examples of quantum mechanical phenomena on a macroscopic scale.
We used exciton-polaritons – the bosonic quasiparticles arising from the strong coupling between photons and excitons in a semiconductor microcavity – to generate chains of same-sign vortices by injecting angular momentum into a polariton superfluid.
We show that at high polariton density the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton repulsion completely dominate the behaviour of the system that can be described as an interacting 2D quantum fluid. 
Importantly, the radial distribution of the topological excitations is shown experimentally and theoretically to be due to the hydrodynamical flow of polaritons, showing a completely new physics with respect to optical vortex generation.
