While very efficient sources of non-classical light, essentially based on bulk non-linear crystals, have been developed in the last twenty years, the quest for integrated quantum sources is a major challenge for the cutting edge research activity in the field of quantum information technologies. 
In this context polaritons offer the appealing possibility to generate non-classical states of light from an all-semiconductor, microscopic structure. 
Even more interesting is the fact that such a polariton device would work in the continuous variable regime, which has seen only few experimental achievements so far in semiconductor materials. 

Additionally, for our polariton system the working intensity zone is substantially lower than in other semiconductor systems. 
In small-size devices such as the micropillars we used, this means the power needed for such devices (5-20 mW) is lower than in any previous experiments.
