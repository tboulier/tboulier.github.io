Continuous light source light sources are a notorious challenge for semiconductor systems. 
One of my goals has been the realization of such squeezed states by exploiting the strong excitonics nonlinearities. 
The exciton part of polaritons induces a Kerr-type optical nonlinearity within the microcavity, about two orders of magnitude higher than in nonlinear crystals.

This allows the observation of an optical bistability. At certain points of this bistability, nonlinearites change the statistical properties of the fluid. 
In particular, the density fluctuations can be reduced: it is a compressed state in intensity for the polariton field. 
This compressed state is then found in the emission of the cavity, which then acts as a compressed state source.

In a planar cavity, this is obscured by the coupling to the mode continuum (the dispersion relation is continuous). 
However, it is possible to discretize the polaritonic modes by lateral confinement. 
In collaboration with the group of Jacqueline Bloch and Alberto Amo at C2N, we developed narrow pillars (2.5 μm in diameter and a height of 10 μm).

The addition of several enhancements such as an asymmetry in the optical cavity, a larger number of quantum wells, and the use of a large photonic fraction (75%) resulted in a new intensity compression record (~ 36%) for this type of system.

Our paper is available in open-access at [Nature Communications 5, 3260, (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4260). 
The all-semiconductor composition of this new source, its small size, and its low power requirement make it an interesting proof of principle for future quantum technologies.
