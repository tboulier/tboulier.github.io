[Quantized vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vortex) are one of the most striking manifestations of superfluidity, such as found in [Bose-Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate).
In our work with Alberto Bramati at LKB, we used exciton-polaritons to generate elementary vortices (quanta of angular momentum) by injecting a global angular momentum into a polariton superfluid.
Since polaritons have a short lifetime, many questions remain open: is the angular momentum conserved? Can a large angular momentum spontaneously break down into individual quanta?
How long does the angular momentun survives?

In a series of studies, we tackle some of these questions. We show that vortex lattices can arise from the superfluid flow ([Phys. Rev. B 89, 134501 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.134501), preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1186)), 
that angular momentum can be injected by careful engineering of the superfluid flow ([Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 116402 (2016)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.116402), pre-print[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02680)), 
and that patterns of elementary vortices of the same sign can be engineered with light-shaping technologies, in [Sci. Rep. 5, 9230 (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09230).

This body for work shows that, at high polariton density, the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton repulsion completely dominates the behaviour of the system. 
In turn, this makes the system well described as a 2D superfluid, while without interactions the system is descibed by linear interferences (coherent optics).
Interactions between many photons therefore drive a transition between quanum optics and quantum hydrodynamics!
