Engineering complex quantum states is the bedrock for advanced applications and tests of quantum mechanics. It requires controlling coherent interactions between several subsystems. 
Atoms with a highly excited electron, called Rydberg atoms, offer a promising way for both strong and controlled interactions. 
However, the excited electron can only remain for a limited time in the excited state; while this limitation is manageable for a few interacting Rydberg atoms, complex phenomena can arise between many strongly interacting atoms. 
In particular, we recently observed an extremely fast loss of coherence in large Rydberg ensembles placed on an optical lattice. This configuration is typical of experiments aiming at achieving quantum simulation with cold atoms.
This is therefore important to consider in current and future experiments, and needs to be understood. However much of this complex effect is still unknown: How ubiquitous is it? 
What are the exact dynamics? What are its relevant timescales? How can we model it? Can we mitigate or control it? Our work is a first effort to answer these questions.

In a first paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08710.pdf), we highlight the existance of this mecanism and point out its prevalence in many large Rydberg system.

Subsequent articles, available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01752.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02460.pdf, respectively describe the complex competition between blockade and antiblockade in these systems, and how distinct Rydberg populations indirectly induce decoherence on each other. 
We discuss several approaches to circumvent these effects and find that, while challenging, they can be mitigated.
